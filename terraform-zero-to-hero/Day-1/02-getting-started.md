* To get started with Terraform, it's important to understand some key terminology & concepts. Here are some fundamental terms & explanations.

1. **Provider**: A provider is a plugin for Terraform that defines & manages resources for a specific cloud or infrastructure platform. Examples of providers include AWS, Azure, Google Cloud & many others. We configure providers in our Terraform code to interact with the desired infrastructure platform.

2. **Resource**: A resource is a specific infrastructure component that we want to create & manage using Terraform. Resources can include virtual machines, databases, storage buckets, network components and more. Each resource has a type & configuration parameters that we define in our Terraform code.

3. **Module**: A module is a reusable & encapsulated unit of Terraform code. Modules allow us to package infrastructure configurations, making it easier to maintain, share, and reuse them across different parts of our infrastructure. Modules can be our own creations or come from the Terraform Registry, which hosts community-contributed modules.

4. **Configuration File**: Terraform uses configuration files (often with a `.tf` extension) to define the desired infrastructure state. These files specify providers, resources, variables, and other settings. The primary configuration file is usually named `main.tf`, but we can use multiple configuration files as well.

5. **Variable**: Variables in Terraform are placeholders for values that can be passed into our configurations. They make our code more flexible and reusable by allowing us to define values outside of our code & pass them in when we apply the Terraform configuration.

6. **Output**: Outputs are values generated by Terraform after the infrastructure has been created or updated. Outputs are typically used to display information or provide values to other parts of our infrastructure stack.

7. **State File**: Terraform maintains a state file (often named as `terraform.tfstate`) that keeps track of the current state of our infrastructure. This file is crucial for Terraform to understand what resources have been created & what changes need to be made during updates.

8. **Plan**: A Terraform plan is a preview of changes that Terraform will make to our infrastructure. When we run `terraform plan`, Terraform analyzes our configuration & current state, then generates a plan detailing what actions it will take during the `apply` step.

9. **Apply**: The `terraform apply` command is used to execute the changes specified in the plan. It creates, updates, or destroys resources based on the Terraform configuration.

10. **Workspace**: Workspaces in Terraform are a way to manage multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production) with separate configurations & state files. Workspaces help keep infrastructure configurations isolated and organized.

11. **Remote Backend**: A remote backend is a storage location for our Terraform state files that is not stored locally. Popular choices for remote backends include Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, or HashiCorp Terraform Cloud. Remote backends enhance collaboration & provide better security & reliability for our state files.

* These are some of the essential terms we will encounter when working with Terraform. As we start using Terraform for our infrastructure provisioning & management, we will become more familiar with these concepts & how they fit together in our IaC workflows.
